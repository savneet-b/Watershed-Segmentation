# Watershed-Segmentation
The primary objective is to achieve segmentation of input images using both standard and marker-based watershed. To achieve normal watershed segmentation, we compute the magnitude and scale the image. For marker-based watershed we do the same as normal watershed but generate a thresholded version and compute the chamfer distance image.
